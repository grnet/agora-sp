Agora there are two ways to login:

* Basic authentication : Where user credentials are stored in the local database and verified from there.

* Authentication via third party proxy with multiply identity providers ( *using Shibboleth* ) : In this case, an external trusted provider authenticates the user.

**All users except the *superuser* will register and log in via the respective provider.**

Authentication and Authorization
=================================

A new user who has just registered on Agora, acquires only the right of access to the service as an observer.
That is why it automatically enters the category of `Observer` users.
To grant more permissions, these it must be assigned by a `Superadmin` user.
See below the categories of users that exist as well as their respective rights.
