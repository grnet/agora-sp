**Resource admins**:  Resource Admins are users that own and manage one or more resources. A Resource Admin belongs to an Organization and can manage his own resources.  


## The Process

When a user is registered to the service, he is registered as an observer.
In order to be a `Resource Admin` the `Superadmin` or `Provider Admin` should change his role.
The `Superadmin` or `Provider Admin` will make him a `Resource Admin` and assign him to an organization .
By the time the user belongs to an Organization then  via the "Resource Admins" a Resource  can be assigned to him.


## List Resource Admins

To view the list of all Resource Admins, a `Superadmin`, `Provider Admin` or `Resource Admin` user must click to the **Resource Admins** left sidebar menu option.
