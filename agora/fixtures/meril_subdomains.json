However, the term library has extended its meaning to refer to any collection, including digital sources, resources, and services. The collections can be of print, audio, and visual materials in numerous formats, including maps, prints, documents, microform (microfilm/microfiche), CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, video games, e-books, audiobooks and many other electronic resources. A research library is a collection of useful material for research use. A library is organised for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organising information and at interpreting information needs. Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analysing tremendous amounts of information with a variety of digital tools. Libraries are valuable to all scientific domains; however, they are of specific relevance to Humanities research which relies on access to historical and rare collections of unique artefacts (e.g. primary sources such as ancient manuscripts) and other sources to study those artefacts and works (secondary and tertiary sources) usually held within libraries and otherwise hardly accessible. A scientific discipline called library and information science, an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field dedicated to the analysis, collection, organisation, classification, manipulation, preservation, retrieval and dissemination of information resources, has established itself at the crossroads between social sciences, humanities and computer sciences. Historically, library science has also included archival science.\"",

In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archives are thus particularly relevant to the Humanities, chiefly to historians but also to many other Humanities researchers dealing with primary sources of various kinds. A scientific discipline called archival science, dedicated to the study and practice of organising, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives, has established itself within the Humanities: History Archives, Literature and Text Archives.",
